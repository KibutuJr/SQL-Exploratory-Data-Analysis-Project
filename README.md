# SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of **SQL in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** by applying a range of analytical techniques to uncover insights from data. SQL is not just a querying language—it is also a robust tool for **exploring, segmenting, and analyzing datasets** directly within the database environment, making it invaluable for data analysts and business intelligence professionals.
It features a collection of SQL scripts showcasing analytical techniques, including trend analysis, cumulative calculations, performance evaluation, data segmentation, and part-to-whole analysis.

The repository contains **well-structured SQL scripts** that cover multiple exploratory techniques, including:

* **Trend and Time-Series Analysis** – identifying changes and developments over time.
* **Cumulative Metrics** – building running totals and progressive growth metrics.
* **Performance Evaluation** – measuring key performance indicators and comparing across dimensions.
* **Data Segmentation** – breaking data into groups for deeper insight.
* **Part-to-Whole Analysis** – understanding contributions of individual segments to the overall dataset.

This project emphasizes **practical, real-world use cases** of SQL in business and analytics settings. It is designed for learners, aspiring analysts, and professionals looking to sharpen their SQL skills while practicing structured EDA.

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

1. **Showcase SQL’s versatility** in handling exploratory data analysis without exporting to other tools.
2. **Develop reusable SQL queries** that can be adapted for multiple datasets and scenarios.
3. **Provide clear, step-by-step examples** of how to answer key business questions with SQL.
4. **Bridge the gap** between raw data and actionable insights.

## 📊 Key Analyses and Techniques

### 1. Trend Analysis

* Examines **how metrics change over time**.
* Example: Monthly sales growth, year-over-year revenue comparison.
* SQL queries include **date functions, window functions, and aggregations** to track changes.

### 2. Cumulative Metrics

* Builds **running totals and progressive measures**.
* Example: Cumulative revenue, running customer acquisition count.
* Useful for evaluating long-term growth and progress towards goals.

### 3. Performance Evaluation

* Compares **KPIs across different dimensions** (region, product, customer segment).
* Example: Highest performing regions, top-selling products, customer lifetime value.
* Queries highlight SQL’s ability to rank, filter, and aggregate data efficiently.

### 4. Data Segmentation

* Breaks data into **meaningful subgroups** for deeper exploration.
* Example: Customer segmentation by demographics, product categories, or revenue bands.
* Helps uncover patterns and identify target opportunities.

### 5. Part-to-Whole Analysis

* Measures the **contribution of parts to a whole**.
* Example: Market share by product, percentage contribution of regions to total sales.
* Techniques include percentages, ratios, and window functions.
